Code for a special entry machine
This is a special machine to entry numbers and special characters
with a dial and som special function keys.
More description inside the code.
The originals are collected form the Internet.

The Arduino Leonardo only speaks "English Keyboard".
To enable the use on a German machine I am using the library from Michael Dworkin.
